Anthony Davis|Anthony Davis to Lakers|Package headed to New Orleans includes Lonzo Ball, 3 1st-round picks|Several people familiar with the situation say the New Orleans Pelicans have agreed to trade disgruntled six-time all-star Anthony Davis to the Los Angeles Lakers for point guard Lonzo Ball, forward Brandon Ingram, shooting guard Josh Hart and three first-round draft choices.The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the trade cannot become official until the new league year begins July 6. ESPN first reported the trade.The trade pairs the 26-year-old Davis, who is among the game's biggest stars and requested a trade in late January, with 34-year-old superstar LeBron James. It also gives the Pelicans promising young players and the opportunity to acquire more.New Orleans already had the first pick overall in Thursday's draft and will have the Lakers' fourth overall choice, giving new basketball operations chief David Griffin to add another top-tier prospect to his presumed first pick of Duke star Zion Williamson.It remains to be seen, however, how well Ingram will recover from a blood clot that sidelined him for part of last season. He was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in March.The Lakers and Pelicans missed the playoffs and Davis' trade demand last season caused a palpable degree of acrimony between the clubs because Davis and James share an agent, who told the Pelicans that the Lakers were among Davis' preferred trade destinations. Shortly after the trade deadline passed with no deal, Davis finished out the season as a lame-duck all-star and the Pelicans fired then-general manager Dell Demps.The 16-time champion Lakers even disrupted last season with their public pursuit of Davis. Several Lakers players acknowledged they were shaken by thoughts of their possibly imminent departure, and those resulting losses slid them out of playoff position at midseason.|Last Updated: Sun,16 Jun 2019 00:20:20
 Canada tops New Zealand| Canada tops New Zealand|Fleming, Prince provide offence in 2-0 win|Jessie Fleming and Nichelle Prince scored second-half goals as Canada moved into the round of 16 at the Women's World Cup with a 2-0 win over New Zealand on Saturday.    As in the opening 1-0 win over No. 46 Cameroon, goals proved hard to come by initially for the fifth-ranked Canadians despite dominating play.  The breakthrough came in the 48th minute. A probing long ball found Prince down the left flank and the speedy forward outraced two defenders before squaring the ball for the 21-year-old Fleming to slot in her ninth goal in 68 appearances â€” and first at the World Cup.    Captain Christine Sinclair almost made it 2-0 soon after, but her redirect from in front went high. And Sinclair set up the 24-year-old Prince in the 72nd minute, only to have her header acrobatically steered away by goalkeeper Erin Nayler in a marvellous one-handed save.    he Canadian women have never before opened the World Cup with two straight wins. And they had never beaten a confederation champion (New Zealand is the big fish among the Oceania minnows) at the tournament.    The Canadians now head 600 kilometres north to Reims, where they will face the eighth-ranked Netherlands on Thursday at Stade Auguste-Delaune to decide who tops Group E.|Last Updated: Sun,16 Jun 2019 00:22:40
